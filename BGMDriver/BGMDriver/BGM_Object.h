//  TODO: Update the large comment below to reflect what was removed from SA_Object.h? It hasn't
//        been changed at all so far, except to replace "SA_Object" with "BGM_Object".

//==================================================================================================
//	BGM_Object
//
//	This is the base class for objects managed by BGM_ObjectMap. It's only job is to ensure that
//	objects of this type have the proper external semantics for a reference counted object. This
//	means that the desctructor is protected so that these objects cannot be deleted directly. Also,
//	these objects many not make a copy of another object or be assigned from another object. Note
//	that the reference count of the object is tracked and owned by the BGM_ObjectMap.
//
//	These objects provide RTTI information tied to the constants describing the HAL's API class
//	hierarchy as described in the headers. The class ID and base class IDs passed in to the
//	constructor must operate with the semantics described in AudioObjectBase.h where the base class
//	has to always be one of the standard classes. The class ID can be a custom value or a standard
//	value however. If it is a standard value, the base class should be the proper standard base
//	class. So for example, a standard volume control object will say that it's class is
//	kAudioVolumeControlClassID and that its base class is kAudioLevelControlClassID. In the case of
//	a custom boolean control, it would say that it's class is a custom value like 'MYBL' and that
//	its base class is kAudioBooleanControlClassID.
//
//	Subclasses of this class must implement Activate(). This method is called after an object has
//	been constructed and inserted into the object map. Until Activate() is called, a constructed
//	object may not do anything active such as sending/receiving notifications or creating other
//	objects. Active operations may be performed in the Activate() method proper however. Note that
//	Activate() is called prior to any references to the object being handed out. As such, it does
//	not need to worry about being thread safe while Activate() is in progress.
//
//	Subclasses of this class must also implement Deactivate(). This method is called when the object
//	is at the end of it's lifecycle. Once Deactivate() has been called, the object may no longer
//	perform active opertions, including Deactivating other objects. This is based on the notion that
//	all the objects have a definite point at which they are considered dead to the outside world.
//	For example, an AudioDevice object is dead if it's hardware is unplugged. The point of death is
//	the notification the owner of the device gets to signal that it has been unplugged. Note that it
//	is both normal and expected that a dead object might still have outstanding references. Thus, an
//	object has to put in some care to do the right thing when these zombie references are used. The
//	best thing to do is to just have those queries return appropriate errors.
//
//	Deactivate() itself needs to be thread safe with respect to other operations taking place on the
//	object. This also means taking care to handle the Deactivation of owned objects. For example, an
//	AudioDevice object will almost always own one or more AudioStream objects. If the stream is in a
//	separate lock domain from it's owning device, then the device has to be very careful about how
//	it deactivates the stream such that it doesn't try to lock the stream's lock while holding the
//	device's lock which will inevitably lead to a deadlock situation. There are two reasonable
//	approaches to dealing with this kind of situation. The first is to just not get into it by
//	making the device share a lock domain with all it's owned objects like streams and controls. The
//	other approach is to use dispatch queues to make the work of Deactivating owned objects take
//	place outside of the device's lock domain. For example, if the device needs to deactivate a
//	stream, it can remove the stream from any tracking in the device object and then dispatch
//	asynchronously the Deactivate() call on the stream and the release of the reference the device
//	has on the stream.
//
//	Note that both Activate() and Deactivate() are called by objects at large. Typically,
//	Activate() is called by the creator of the object, usually right after the object has been
//	allocated. Deactivate() will usually be called by the owner of the object upon recognizing that
//	the object is dead to the outside world. Going back to the example of an AudioDevice getting
//	unplugged, the Deactivate() method will be called by whomever receives the notification about
//	the hardware going away, which is often the owner of the object.
//
//	This class also defines methods to implement the portion of the
//	AudioServerPlugInDriverInterface that deals with properties. The five methods all have the same
//	basic arguments and semantics. The class also provides the implementation for
//	the minimum required properties for all AudioObjects. There is a detailed commentary about each
//	specific property in the GetPropertyData() method.
//
//	It is important that a thread retain and hold a reference while it is using an BGM_Object and 
//	that the reference be released promptly when the thread is finished using the object. By
//	assuming this, a BGM_Object can minimize the amount of locking it needs to do. In particular,
//	purely static or invariant data can be handled without any locking at all.
